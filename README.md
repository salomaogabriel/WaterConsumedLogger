# WaterConsumedLogger

While watching the videos or studying, one thing that I do quite often is drinking water from my 500mL bottle and I always wonder how many bottles I usually drink in a day.

I created this application to apply things that I learned in the Treehouse beginning C# Track:
https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginning-c

So I realized that one way to find out is by using the knowledge I got from treehouse and create an application where I can count how many bottles I drink per day.

I also added special commands (Something that I wanted to do in a long time) I don't know if it's implemented in the right way but It's working for now.

If you have any questions or requests, feel free to contact me, although I don't think anyone will ever read this.

I'll include the zipped folder containing the Executable.
